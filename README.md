## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

### Introduction

This is the repository for the final project of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The files required to complete the project are:

* [README.md](README.md): this overview file.
* [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R): the R script that runs all of the analysis to create the tidy
data set
* [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md): the description of the tidy data.

### Study Design

The original data is from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

For the purposes of this project, we are using a version of the data provided by the instructor at [UCI HAR Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

### Running the code

Run the [run_analysis.R](run_analysis.R) script to get the tidy submission data in the file [submit_data.txt](submit_data.txt). Re-running the script will overwrite this file.

The tidy submission data is described in the [CodeBook.md](CodeBook.md) file.
